            Trapped within a windowless apartment, love<br>
            What can we say<br>
            Though it hurts, we're still blinded by love<br>
            <br>
            Although I bleed and I break down<br>
            Don't know what's making me hold out<br>

            This ain't over till it's over believe me<br>
            It's as if we're just waiting for agony<br>
            <br>
            And maybe it's all just for a moment<br>
            Without direction, tell me what you wanna see<br>
            But I don't care, I'll do it over and over<br>

            <br>
            No love letters, no X and Os<br>
            No love, never, my exes know<br>
            No diamond rings that set in stone<br>
            To the left, better left alone<br>
            Didn't wanna be a princess, I'm priceless<br>
            A prince not even on my list<br>
            Love is a drug that I quit<br>
            No doctor can help when I'm lovesick<br>
            <br>
            And maybe it's all just for the moment<br>

            Feel the thrill dissipating<br>
            Leaving us lost now, look at us bleeding<br>
            Can't really hear what you say<br>
            Loving the pain, oh honey<br>
            Hate to break it to you baby<br>

            A little too wild for each other<br>
            Shiny till it wasn't<br>
            Feels good till it doesn't<br>
            <br>
            It was her first real lover<br>
            His too till he had another<br>
            Oh god when she found out<br>
            Trust levels went way down<br>
            
            Of course she was sad<br>
            But now she's glad she dodged a bullet<br>
            <br>
            Took a few years<br>
            To soak up the tears<br>
            But look at her now<br>
            Watch her go<br>
            <br>
            Mmm mmm mmm<br>
            Look at her now<br>
            Watch her go<br>

            Mmm mmm mmm<br>
            Wow<br>
            Look at her now<br>
            <br>
            Fast nights that got him<br>
            That new life was his problem<br>
            Not saying she was perfect<br>
            Still regrets that moment<br>
            <br>
            Like that night<br>
            Wasn't wrong, wasn't right<br>
            What a thing to be human<br>
            Made her more of woman<br>
            <br>
            Of course she was sad<br>
            But now she's glad she dodged a bullet<br>
